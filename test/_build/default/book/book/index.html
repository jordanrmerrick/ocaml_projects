          <h4>Yaron Minsky</h4>

          <p>Yaron Minsky heads the technology group at Jane
          Street, a proprietary trading firm that is the largest
          industrial user of OCaml. He was responsible for
          introducing OCaml to the company and for managing the
          company's transition to using OCaml for all of its core
          infrastructure. Today, billions of dollars worth of
          securities transactions flow each day through those
          systems. Yaron obtained his PhD in Computer Science from
          Cornell University, where he studied distributed systems.
          Yaron has lectured, blogged, and written about OCaml for
          years, with articles published in <em>Communications of
          the ACM</em> and the <em>Journal of Functional
          Programming</em>. He chairs the steering committee of the
          Commercial Users of Functional Programming, and is a
          member of the steering committee for the International
          Conference on Functional Programming.</p>

          <p>Anil Madhavapeddy is a senior research fellow at the
          University of Cambridge, based in the Systems Research
          Group. He was on the original team that developed the Xen
          hypervisor, and he helped develop an industry-leading
          cloud management toolstack written entirely in OCaml.
          This XenServer product has been deployed on hundreds of
          thousands of physical hosts and drives critical
          infrastructure for many Fortune 500 companies. Prior to
          obtaining his PhD in 2006 from the University of
          Cambridge, Anil had a diverse background in industry at
          Network Appliance, NASA, and Internet Vision. In addition
          to professional and academic activities, he is an active
          member of the open source development community with the
          OpenBSD operating system, is co-chair of the Commercial
          Users of Functional Programming workshop, and serves on
          the boards of startup companies such as Ashima Arts,
          where OCaml is extensively used.</p>

          systems for managing and scheduling massively distributed
          computing resources. Prior to joining Google, Jason was
          an assistant professor of Computer Science at Caltech,
          where his research was in reliable and fault-tolerant
          computing systems, including programming language design,
          formal methods, compilers, and new models of distributed
          computation. He obtained his PhD in Computer Science from
          Cornell University, where he studied programming
          languages. He is the author of the MetaPRL system, a
          logical framework for design and analysis of large
          software systems; and OMake, an advanced build system for
          large software projects.</p>
